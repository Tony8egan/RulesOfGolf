        <p>(1) A player must not deliberately remove a loose impediment that, if moved when the ball was at rest, would have been likely to have caused the ball to move.</p>
        <p>(2) If the player does so, he or she gets one penalty stroke, but the removed loose impediment does not need to be replaced.</p>

        <p>The ball must be replaced on its original spot (which if not known must be estimated)</p>
        <p>If the moved ball had been at rest anywhere except on the putting green or in the teeing area, the player gets one penalty stroke, except when Rule 7.4 applies (no penalty for ball moved during search) or under the following exceptions:</p>
        <p>(1) Player was already allowed to Lift or Move Ball based on other rule</p>
        <p>(2) Accidental Movement Before Ball Is Found</p>
        <p>(3) Accidental Movement on Putting Green</p>
        <p>(4) Accidental Movement Anywhere Except on Putting Green While Applying Rule</p>

        <b>My ball marker blocks another players line on the green?</b>
        <p>If your ball marker is blocking the line of another players putt, you can move the marker parallel to it's position in accordance to the hole.</p>
        <p>Use your putter to temporarilly mark and move the ball marker. Place the tip your putter at the point where your ball marker is and use the opposite end as the new spot(while keeping the putter parallel to the hole position) for your ball marker. Make sure you move the marker back to it's original spot when you are replacing the ball to putt. </p>
