            <p>Without penalty, a player may remove a loose impediment anywhere on or off the course, and may do so in any way (such as by using a hand or foot or a club or other equipment).</p>
        <li>A player must not deliberately remove a loose impediment that, if moved when the ball was at rest, would have been likely to have caused the ball to move.</li>
        <li>If the player does so, he or she gets one penalty stroke, but the removed loose impediment does not need to be replaced.</li>

            <br>
            <p>If a playerâ€™s removal of a loose impediment causes his or her ball to move:</p>
        <li>The ball must be replaced on its original spot (which if not known must be estimated)</li>
        <li>If the moved ball had been at rest anywhere except on the putting green (see Rule 13.1d) or in the teeing area (see Rule 6.2b(6)), the player gets one penalty stroke under Rule 9.4b, except when Rule 7.4 applies (no penalty for ball moved during search) or when another exception to Rule 9.4b applies.</li>

        <p>If part of an immovable obstruction or integral object (such as a gate or door or part of an attached cable) meets these two standards, that part is treated as a movable obstruction.</p>
        <p>But this does not apply if the movable part of an immovable obstruction or integral object is not meant to be moved (such as a loose stone that is part of a stone wall).</p>
        <p>Even when an obstruction is movable, the Committee may define it to be an immovable obstruction.</p>

            <br>
        <p>If a players ball marker appears to obstruct the path of your golf ball you can ask your opponent to move their marker.</p>
        <br>
        <b>What if my ball marker blocks another players line on the green?</b>
        <p>If your ball marker is blocking the line of another players putt, you can move the marker parallel to it's position in accordance to the hole.</p>
        <p>Use your putter to temporarilly mark and move the ball marker. Place the tip your putter at the point where your ball marker is and use the opposite end as the new spot(while keeping the putter parallel to the hole position) for your ball marker. Make sure you move the marker back to it's original spot when you are replacing the ball to putt. </p>
        <br>
        <b>What can I use to mark my ball?</b>
        <p>There is no penalty for accidentally causing your ball-marker to move. If this happens, you must either replace the ball-maker or replace your ball on its original spot before making your next stroke</p>
       <br>
        <b>What if my ball marker is accidentally moved?</b>
        <p>Ball-markers must be artificial, such as a tee, coin, the toe of your putter, or other small piece of equipment. A natural object like a leaf or twig may not be used as a ball-marker.</p>
