      <p>If your ball is in a situation that you deem to be unplayable and don't qualify for any other form of relief, you can declare unplayable and take penalty relief.</p>

      <br>
      <p class ="collapsible">Stroke and Distance Relief</p>
      <div class = "TextContent">
      <p>You can take stroke and distance relief even if your ball has not been found or identified. This allows you to play your original ball or a new ball from the point where you took your previous shot. You must take a drop in the approximate spot where the stroke was taken. This will result in a one-shot penalty, adding one shot to your final score for the hole.</p>
      <u>Example:</u>
      <p>John hit his second shot into trees that are technically in play and hasn't been able to locate his ball. He decides to declare an unplayable and take stroke and distance relief. He returns to the point where he hit his 2nd shot from, takes a drop and hits what will now be his 4th shot.</p>
      <br>
    </div>

      <p class ="collapsible">Back on the line relief</p>
      <div class = "TextContent">
      <p>You can take back on the line relief if you are able to locate your golf ball. Back on the line relief allows you to take a drop on the line from the flag to the location of the golf ball, taking the ball back as far back as you like but no closer to the hole. Mark the point where you want to play from and drop your ball. This will result in a one shot penalty, adding one shot to your final score for the hole.</p>
      <u>Example:</u>
      <p>John's 2nd shot lands under a bush and he is not sure that he'll be able to play his ball. He decides to declare and unplayable and take back on the line relief. He observes the line from the ball to the flag and takes a few steps back. He marks the ground on the line no closer to the hole and takes a drop. John is now taking his 4th shot. </p>
      <br>
    </div>

      <p class ="collapsible">Lateral relief</p>
      <div class = "TextContent">
      <p>You can take Lateral relief if you are able to locate your golf ball. Taking the spot of your golf ball as the reference point, you can take a drop with the original ball or a new one, within two club lengths of the reference point but no closer to the hole. This will result in a one shot penalty, adding one shot to your final score for the hole.</p>
      <u>Example:</u>
      <p>John's 2nd shot lands under a bush and he is not sure that he'll be able to play his ball. He decides to declare and unplayable and take Lateral relief. He marks the area where his ball is with a tee. He removes his driver and uses it to measure two club lengths, no closer to the hole. He marks this area ground with a tee and takes a drop. John is now taking his 4th shot. </p>

      <p class ="collapsible">Stroke and Distance Relief (Bunker)</p>
      <div class = "TextContent">
      <p>This allows you to play your original ball or a new ball from the point where you took your previous shot. You must take a drop in the approximate spot where the stroke was taken. This will result in a one-shot penalty, adding one shot to your final score for the hole.</p>
      <u>Example:</u>
      <p>John hit his second shot into the bunker and decides to declare an unplayable and take stroke and distance relief. He returns to the point where he hit his 2nd shot from, takes a drop and hits what will now be his 4th shot.</p>

      <p class ="collapsible">Back on the line relief out of bunker</p>
      <div class = "TextContent">
      <p>It is important to note that back on the line relief where you take the ball out of the bunker is a TWO SHOT penalty. Back on the line relief allows you to take a drop on the line from the flag to the location of the golf ball, taking the ball back as far back as you like but no closer to the hole. Mark the point where you want to play from and drop your ball. This will result in a two shot penalty, adding two shots to your final score for the hole.</p>
      <u>Example:</u>
      <p>John's 2nd shot lands in a bunker and he is not sure that he'll be able to get his ball out of the bunker. He decides to declare and unplayable and take back on the line relief out of the bunker. He observes the line from the ball to the flag, takes a few steps back, marks an area on the ground on the line and makes a drop. John is now taking his 5th shot. </p>

      <p class ="collapsible">Back on the line relief within the bunker</p>
      <div class = "TextContent">
      <p>You can take back on the line relief in bunkers. Back on the line relief allows you to take a drop on the line from the flag to the location of the golf ball, taking the ball back as far back as you like within the bunker but no closer to the hole. Note the point on the line where you want to play from and drop your ball. This will result in a one shot penalty, adding one shot to your final score for the hole.</p>
      <u>Example:</u>
      <p>John's 2nd shot lands in a bunker and he is not sure that he'll be able to get his ball out of the bunker based on how it's positioned. He decides to declare and unplayable and take back on the line relief within the bunker. He observes the line from the ball to the flag, chooses an appropriate spot on the line no closer to the hole, and takes a drop. John is now taking his 4th shot. </p>
