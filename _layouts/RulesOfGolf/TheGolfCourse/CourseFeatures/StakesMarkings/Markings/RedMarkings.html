        <p>Red stakes or red markings indicate a penalty area. 
            If you lose your ball in a penalty area or are unable to play from the lie, 
            you are entitled to take relief from the estimated point of entry. </p>
        
        
        
        <b>What are my Options?</b>
        
        <br>
        <p><b>1.	Play as it lies</b> – If possible, 
            you can play the ball as it lies. This will result in NO penalty to your score. </p>
          
         <p><b>2.	Stroke and Distance relief</b> – One Shot Penalty </p>
  
          <p><b>3.	Back on the line Relief</b> – One Shot Penalty</p>
              
          <p><b>4.	Lateral Relief</b> – One Shot Penalty</p>

        <div class ="TextContent">
        <br>
        <p>You can play your original ball or a new ball 
          from the point you where you took your shot that entered the penalty area. 
          You must take a drop  in the approximate spot where the stroke 
          was taken. This will result in a one-shot penalty, adding one shot to your final 
          score for the hole. </p>

        <br>
        <p>Back on the line Relief can be taken from the 
          estimated point of entry of the golf ball into the penalty area. You can take 
          relief on the line from the flag to the point of entry, taking the ball back 
          as far back as you like. Mark the point where you want to play from and drop 
          your ball. Taking Back on the line Relief will result in a one-shot penalty, 
          adding one shot to your final score for the hole.</p>

        <p class = "collapsible">Lateral Relief</p>
        <div class ="TextContent">
        <br>
        <p>Lateral relief can be taken from the estimated point 
          of entry of the golf ball into the penalty area. You can drop a ball 
          two club lengths from the point of entry, however the drop point must 
          be no nearer to the hole than the estimated point of entry. The ball 
          must cannot be dropped within the penalty area. Taking Lateral Relief 
          will result in a one-shot penalty, adding one shot to your final score for the hole. </p>
  <p>Note: Lateral relief is only available in red marked penalty areas</p>

          <p class = "collapsible">When is my ball considered to be in a penalty area?</p>
          <div class ="TextContent">
          <br>
          <p>A ball is in a penalty area when any part of the ball
            lies on or touches the ground or anything else (such as any natural or artificial object) inside the edge of the penalty area, or
            is above the edge or any other part of the penalty area.</p>

          <p class = "collapsible">How to drop a ball</p>
          <div class ="TextContent">
          <br>
          <p>Mark the point where you will be dropping (with a tee, pitch tool or other). 
            A ball should be dropped from knee height straight down beside the marker. If the ball rolls from 
            the general area that is marked, then you can drop it again. If it rolls more than twice 
            then you can place the ball in the marked area by hand.  </p>
            <p>The ball should fall straight down, without the player throwing, spinning, rolling it or using any other motion that might affect where the ball will come to rest. It should not  touch any part of the player’s body or equipment before it hits the ground.</p>

          <p class = "collapsible">Ball played from Penalty area goes out of Bounds/beyond white stakes?</p> 
          <div class ="TextContent">
          <br>
              <p>If a ball goes beyond white stakes, it is considered out of bounds and relief 
                  cannot be taken from point of entry. For more info on OOB see here. 
                  If you played your shot from the penalty area and your ball went out of bounds, 
                  you have two options 
                  </p>
  
          <br>
              <p><b>1.	Stroke and Distance relief </b>– You can play your original ball or a new ball from the point you where you took your shot. You must take a drop in the approximate spot where the stroke was taken. This will result in a one-shot penalty, adding one shot to your final score for the hole. </p>
        
              <p><b>2.	Back on the line Relief</b> – Back on the line Relief can be taken from the estimated point of entry of the golf ball into the penalty area. You can take relief on the line from the flag to the point of entry, taking the ball back as far back as you like. Mark the point where you want to play from and drop your ball. 
  
          Taking Back on the line Relief in this scenario will result in a two-shot penalty (one shot for stroke and distance relief and one shot for taking back on the line relief), adding two shots to your final score for the hole.
        </p>
  
          <p><b>3.	Lateral Relief</b> – Lateral relief can be taken from the estimated point of entry of the golf ball into the penalty area. You can drop a ball two club lengths from the point of entry, however the drop point must be no nearer to the hole than the estimated point of entry. The ball must cannot be dropped within the penalty area. 
  
              Taking lateral relief in this scenario will result in a two-shot penalty (one shot for stroke and distance relief and one shot for taking lateral relief), adding two shots to your final score for the hole.</p>
              <p>Note: Lateral relief is only available in red marked penalty areas</p>
          
          <br>
          <br>
  
              <p>The following forms of relief are not valid in a penalty area: </p>
              <li>Interference by an abnormal course condition,</li>
              <li>An embedded ball, or</li>
              <li>An unplayable ball.</li>
